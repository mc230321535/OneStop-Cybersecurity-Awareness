<section id="faqs">
    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <p>Explore answers to commonly asked questions about cybersecurity:</p>
    
    <h3>What is phishing?</h3>
    <p>Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers impersonate legitimate organizations to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, usually through deceptive emails or websites.</p>
    
    <h3>How can I protect myself from malware?</h3>
    <p>To protect yourself from malware, ensure your devices have up-to-date antivirus software installed, avoid downloading files from unknown sources, and be cautious when clicking on links or email attachments from unfamiliar senders.</p>
    
    <h3>What is two-factor authentication (2FA)?</h3>
    <p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts by requiring two forms of identification before granting access. This typically involves something you know (e.g., password) and something you have (e.g., a mobile device).</p>
    
    <h3>Why is encryption important for data security?</h3>
    <p>Encryption is important for data security because it helps protect sensitive information from unauthorized access. By converting data into a ciphertext that can only be decrypted and understood by authorized parties, encryption ensures confidentiality and integrity, even if the data is intercepted.</p>
    
    <h3>How can I secure my Wi-Fi network?</h3>
    <p>To secure your Wi-Fi network, use strong encryption (such as WPA2 or WPA3), change the default administrator password for your router, enable network encryption, hide your Wi-Fi network's SSID (service set identifier), and regularly update your router's firmware.</p>
    
    <h3>What should I do if my computer is infected with malware?</h3>
    <p>If your computer is infected with malware, disconnect it from the internet to prevent further damage, run a full system scan with antivirus software to remove the malware, and restore your system from a backup if necessary. Be sure to change passwords for any compromised accounts.</p>
    
    <h3>How can I stay safe while using public Wi-Fi?</h3>
    <p>To stay safe while using public Wi-Fi, avoid accessing sensitive information (such as online banking or shopping) over unsecured networks, use a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your internet connection, and turn off sharing settings to prevent unauthorized access to your device.</p>
    
    <h3>What is a firewall and how does it protect my network?</h3>
    <p>A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between your internal network and external networks, blocking potentially harmful traffic and unauthorized access attempts.</p>
    
    <h3>Why is patch management important for cybersecurity?</h3>
    <p>Patch management is important for cybersecurity because it helps protect your systems and software from known vulnerabilities and exploits. By regularly applying security patches and updates, you can mitigate the risk of cyber attacks and data breaches.</p>
    
    <h3>What is social engineering and how can I avoid falling victim to it?</h3>
    <p>Social engineering is a technique used by cyber attackers to manipulate individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security. To avoid falling victim to social engineering, be cautious of unsolicited requests for information, verify the identity of individuals requesting sensitive information, and educate yourself and your employees about common social engineering tactics.</p>
    
    <h3>How can I create strong passwords?</h3>
    <p>To create strong passwords, use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using easily guessable information such as birthdays or common words, and use unique passwords for each of your accounts.</p>
    
    <h3>What is the dark web and how does it pose a threat to cybersecurity?</h3>
    <p>The dark web is a part of the internet that is not indexed by search engines and requires specific software, configurations, or authorization to access. It is often used for illegal activities, such as selling stolen data, drugs, and malware, making it a threat to cybersecurity.</p>
    
    <h3>How can I protect my personal information online?</h3>
    <p>To protect your personal information online, be cautious about sharing sensitive information on social media and other websites, use privacy settings to control who can see your information, and be selective about the websites and apps you use.</p>
    
    <h3>What is a data breach and how can I prevent it?</h3>
    <p>A data breach is an incident where sensitive, protected, or confidential information is accessed or disclosed without authorization. To prevent data breaches, implement security measures such as encryption, access controls, and regular security audits, and train employees on cybersecurity best practices.</p>
    
    <h3>What is ransomware and how can I protect my data from it?</h3>
    <p>Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts files on your computer and demands payment for their decryption. To protect your data from ransomware, regularly back up your files to an external storage device or cloud service, and be cautious about clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources.</p>
    
    <h3>How can I detect and respond to security incidents?</h3>
    <p>To detect and respond to security incidents, monitor your network and systems for suspicious activity, establish incident response procedures, and train employees on how to recognize and report security incidents. Additionally, consider implementing security incident detection and response tools and partnering with a trusted cybersecurity provider.</p>
    
    <h3>What is a vulnerability assessment and why is it important?</h3>
    <p>A vulnerability assessment is a process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, and applications. It is important for cybersecurity because it helps organizations understand their security posture, prioritize remediation efforts, and reduce the risk of cyber attacks and data breaches.</p>
    
    <h3>How can I protect my mobile devices from security threats?</h3>
    <p>To protect your mobile devices from security threats, use a strong passcode or biometric authentication, keep your device's operating system and apps updated, only download apps from trusted sources, and be cautious when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks.</p>
    
    <h3>What is endpoint security and why is it important?</h3>
    <p>Endpoint security refers to the protection of endpoints (such as computers, smartphones, and tablets) from cyber threats. It is important because endpoints are often targeted by cyber attackers and can serve as entry points into an organization's network, making them vulnerable to security breaches.</p>
    
    <h3>What is identity theft and how can I prevent it?</h3>
    <p>Identity theft is a type of cyber crime where an attacker steals someone's personal information (such as Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, or bank account information) to commit fraud or other crimes. To prevent identity theft, safeguard your personal information, be cautious about sharing sensitive information online, and monitor your financial accounts for suspicious activity.</p>
